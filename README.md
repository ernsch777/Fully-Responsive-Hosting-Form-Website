1. # Fully-Responsive-Hosting-Form-Website
2. This is a Brad Traversery Media code along from YouTube; for practice. 
3. Almost done but will add a scaled up version.
4. Finished site with additional Features and Docs pages.  Animations not working yet but will figure it out. 
5. Fixed missing div tag in footer for text and copyright layout. Fixed color on documentation page links. The header navbar color of white was overriding the "* body" text color of gray.
6. Adjusted hover border to gray and added padding to links to make it look better. Tweakked the Logo and navbar links to make them bigger, adjusted the vertical spacing and margins between elements and sections to balance visual heirarchy and smoothness. Cut the footer margin down to better size.
7. Added a home page link to the main logo on all pages.
8. Got rid of the horizontal scroll bar on the showcase card for intermediate screen sizes.
9.  Centered three flex items within their boxes at all size screens.
10. Still need to center footer items and get rid of text alignment problems in header of features and doc pages.
